Auth Example's Hasura's Read Model - PostgreSQL via Zalando PostgreSQL Operator to set up the database, and Schemahero to configure that database's schema.

This database and it's schema are an example in this bigger [project](https://github.com/CloudNativeEntrepreneur/web3auth-meta).

Hasura generates graphql API's based on a DB schema, so you can define your database schema here, and connect it to hasura, and you'll have a graphql API for it.
